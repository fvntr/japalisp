# Japalisp
Japanese Programming Language as natural as possible.

# Why you made this?
I wanted non-programmer Japanese(my friends) to realize "thinking about computing is one of the most exciting things the human mind can do (from The Little Schemer)â€œ.
Also, I wanted to explain beauty of Japanese language to non-Japanese programmer :)

# What does it do?
* If you're familiar with the book "The Little Schemer", this language should compute most functions introduced in the book Chapter 4 "Numbers Games".
* which means you can:
  * define function
  * call funcation
  * do basic numeric calculation(using its underlying language)

# Examples
